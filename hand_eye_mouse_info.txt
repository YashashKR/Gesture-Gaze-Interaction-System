1. Project Overview
The Multimodal Air Canvas is a comprehensive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system. It combines Computer Vision and AI to allow touchless control of a computer using hands and eyes. It features four main modes: Hand Control, Eye Tracking, Air Canvas, and a Gesture Game.

2. Hand Gesture Control Mode
- Technology: Uses MediaPipe Hands to track 21 landmarks on the hand.
- Cursor Movement: The mouse cursor follows the tip of the Index Finger.
- Left Click & Drag: Perform a "Pinch" gesture (bring Thumb and Index finger close together).
- Scrolling:
  • Scroll Down: Move Index finger tip *below* the Middle finger tip.
  • Scroll Up: Move Index finger tip *above* the Middle finger tip.
- Smoothing: Uses an algorithm to reduce cursor shaking/jitter.

3. Eye Tracking Control Mode
- Technology: Uses MediaPipe Face Mesh to detect iris position and eye landmarks.
- Cursor Movement: Tracks the center of the user's Iris to move the mouse.
- Left Click: Perform a "Double Blink" (blink both eyes quickly).
- Scroll Down: Wink the Left Eye.
- Scroll Up: Wink the Right Eye.
- Calibration: Requires good lighting and the user to sit at a stable distance from the camera.

4. Air Canvas (Virtual Drawing Board)
- Drawing Gesture: Raise *only* the Index Finger to draw.
- Hover Mode: Raise both Index and Middle fingers to move without drawing.
- Tools & Features:
  • Virtual Toolbar: Buttons for Clear, Eraser, Undo, Info, and Save.
  • Color Palette: Select colors from the sidebar on the left.
  • Brush Styles: Supports Normal, Dashed, Zigzag, and Straight lines.
  • Saving: Can save the current artwork as an image file.
- Shortcuts:
  • 'C': Clear Canvas
  • 'E': Eraser
  • 'U': Undo
  • 'S': Toggle Stroke Style
  • 'M': Toggle Dark/Light Mode

5. Gesture-Controlled Snake Game
- Gameplay: A classic Snake game controlled entirely by hand movements.
- Control Logic: Detects the direction of the Index Finger relative to the Wrist.
- Controls:
  • Point UP: Move Snake Up
  • Point DOWN: Move Snake Down
  • Point LEFT: Move Snake Left
  • Point RIGHT: Move Snake Right
- Technology: Built using Pygame for graphics and OpenCV for control.

6. Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Cyberpunk/AI Theme), JavaScript.
- Backend: Python (Flask).
- AI & Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe, Google Gemini API (for the Chatbot).
- Automation: PyAutoGUI (for mouse control).
- Game Engine: Pygame.

7. System Advantages
- Accessibility: Helps users with motor impairments use computers without physical devices.
- Hygiene: Touchless interface ideal for medical or public settings.
- Multimodal: Offers multiple ways to interact (Hand, Eye, or Voice/Chat).

8. Limitations
- Lighting: Performance drops in dark rooms.
- Stability: Eye tracking requires a steady head position.
- Hardware: Requires a functioning webcam.

Summary

The Multimodal Air Canvas is a touchless Human-Computer Interaction system that uses computer vision to enable mouse control, virtual drawing, and gaming through hand gestures and eye movements. It unifies these features into a Flask-based web application with a modern UI, allowing users to switch between a gesture mouse, an eye tracker, a digital whiteboard, and a gesture-controlled snake game. The system also integrates a Gemini-powered AI chatbot to answer user queries about controls and functionality.
